## 1 - Business Problems ( Problemas de Negócio )

### 1.1 - Business Problems

**NorthWind Traders** is a fictional store that manages orders, products, customers, suppliers, and many other aspects of a small business. It has reports made on spreadsheets on demand.

When the company was small, this format worked, but now with the accelerated growth of the company, **data from different areas started to not match**, and meetings became more conflicting. The company also wants to better understand its data to **increase the average ticket** and **reduce churn** (two objectives considered strategic in the medium term).

## 2 - Solution Strategy ( Estratégia de Solução )

**CRISP-DM** stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, which can be translated as Standard Process for Inter-Industry Data Mining. It is a data mining process model that describes commonly used approaches by data mining experts to tackle problems.

As a basis for this project, we will use CRISP, and once the entire first cycle of CRISP is completed, we can make further iterations, create new features, generate new insights, and improve model performance, all to deliver more value to the company. It is also important to engage with stakeholders in the project throughout the process, to keep them informed and manage their expectations.

All codes and visualizations of this project can be followed in this [Notebook](Notebook.ipynb).

### 2.1 - Data Organizations Problem

1. As a way to better manage the data conflicts generated by the accelerated growth of the company, an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) was developed so that different areas can have access to more accurate information.

2. Customer Dataframe: Information such as lifespan, churn, etc. was presented from data unions.
This data frame was created to analyze all customer information.

3. Order Order Dataframe: By unifying tables such as “order” and “order_details”, and generating new information from data combinations, an order data frame was created, facilitating data analysis.

### 3.2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Descriptive statistics: allow us to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data, and to communicate these findings clearly and concisely.
